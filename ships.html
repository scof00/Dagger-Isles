    In "The Dagger Isles," ships are more than just vessels; they are the lifeblood of piracy, the primary mode of transportation, and the very homes for daring adventurers. As players traverse the vast expanse of the high seas, their ships become extensions of themselves, embodying their dreams of freedom, adventure, and fortune. From sleek sloops to formidable galleons, each vessel tells a story of its captain's aspirations and ambitions. In this campaign, players have the opportunity to customize and own their own ships, transforming them into formidable warships, merchant vessels, or even floating fortresses. Through upgrades, modifications, and crew recruitment, players can tailor their ships to suit their playstyle, whether as cunning pirates, noble privateers, or intrepid explorers. With their ships as their steadfast companions, players will chart their own course through the turbulent waters of "The Dagger Isles," seeking glory, riches, and adventure on the high seas. <br><br><a href="shipSheet.docx" download><b>Click here to download the ship character sheet.</b></a><br><br>**Players can have a maximum of 1 ship per player. Ships not actively being used by players can be turned into a fleet that can carry out operations and trades in the players' absence, up to the DM's disgression. If ships are being used in combat, at least 1 player has to be captaining each ship.**
