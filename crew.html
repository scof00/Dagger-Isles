    Players are able to hire NPCs to add to their crew and grow their pirate empire. Crew members can be added to their current ship, as bigger ships require more hands to operate, or can be assigned to their own ship and operate on players behalf. Below is a table detailing the cost and bonuses of different recruits.

    Every player level up, you can choose to upgrade an existing crew member to the next tier, they cost half the price, and their morale is harder to bring down. A single crew member can only move up 1 tier every level up, i.e. if the party levels up and only has one crew member, that crew member doesnâ€™t jump to a tier 4 recruit.<br><br> Below is a chart about "Morale." Morale is a measurement of much your crew likes or dislikes you, based on a variety of factors. It is measured on a scale of 1-100, with the starting value of 50. Morale is measure on a per crew basis if the players win a fight very handedly, and they have 5 crew members, that would be a +3 morale for each member, totaling a +15 to their morale score. <br><br> When morale is high, crew member will be more willing to die for their captain, take on more dangerous missions, won't abandon ship, etc.<br>When morale is low, crew may surrender in battle, leave the crew, or in extreme cases, backstab or commit mutiny.
