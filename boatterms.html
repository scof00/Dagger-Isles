  <p><strong><u>Definitions:</u></strong></p>
  <p><u>Hull:</u> the hull is the bottom part of the boat that sits partially in the water.</p>
  <p><u>Bow:</u> The bow of the boat refers to the most forward part of the hull or the front of the boat.</p>
  <p><u>Stern:</u> The stern of the boat refers to the rear of the boat.</p>
  <p><u>Helm:</u>The helm of a boat is the area where the steering wheel is located.</p>
  <p><u>Port:</u> When looking forwards at the bow, the port side is the left-hand side of the boat</p>
  <p><u>Starboard:</u> When looking forwards at the bow, the starboard side is the right-hand side of the boat.</p>
  <p><u>Aft:</u> Aft simply means towards the rear or stern of the boat.  </p>
  <p><u>Forward:</u> Forward is referring to the area towards the front, or bow, of the boat.</p>
  <p><u>Underway:</u> If the vessel is floating, drifting, or in motion using the motor it would count as underway.</p>
  <p><u>Keel:</u> The keel is a long, heavy fin on the bottom of the boat that sticks down into the water. It provides stability and is the reason why modern sailboats are nearly impossible to capsize.</p>
  <p><u>Heeling:</u> This is the term for when a sailboat leans over in the water, pushed by the wind. There’s nothing else like the thrill of heeling over as your sails fill and your speed picks up!</p>
  <p><u>Tack:</u> This term has two distinct meanings, both of them very important. As a verb, to tack is to change direction by turning the bow of the boat through the wind. As a noun, your tack is the course you are on relative to the wind. For example, if the wind is blowing over the port side, you are on a port tack. If it’s blowing over the starboard side, you’re on a…you guessed it…starboard tack.</p>
  <p><u>Jibe:</u> A jibe is another way of changing direction, in which you bring the stern of the boat through the wind. Whether you choose to tack or jibe entirely depends on the situation–what’s around you, and the direction of the wind.</p>
  <p><u>Windward:</u> The side of the boat closest to the wind. When heeling over, this will always be the high side.</p>
  <p><u>Leeward:</u> The side of the boat furthest from the wind. When heeling over, this will always be the low side.</p>
  <p><u>Lines:</u> On board a boat, this is what you say instead of “ropes.”
</p>
  <p><u>Mainsail:</u> The big triangular sail just aft of the sailboat’s mast. As the name suggests, this is the boat’s largest and most important sail. Running along its bottom edge, the mainsail has a thick pole called the boom.</p>
  <p><u>Jib:</u> The next most common sail on any boat. The jib can always be found forward of the mast, and unlike the mainsail, does not have a boom.</p>
  <p><u>Rigging:</u> Rigging is the name for the system of wire cables and ropes that both support the sails and allow them to be controlled. </p>
  <p><u>Ease:</u> To let out the sails.</p>
  <p><u>Trim:</u> To pull the sails in.</p>
  <p> <u>Luffing:</u> The flapping of the whole sail, flogging – when sails are over eased </p>
  <p><u>Starboard Tack:</u> wind is coming from the starboard (right) side of the boat </p>
  <p><u>Port Tack:</u> wind is coming from the port (left) side of the boat </p>
  <p><strong><u>Sailing Maneuvers:</u></strong></p>
  <p><u>Coming-About (Tacking):</u> In this maneuver, the bow of the boat goes through the wind as one changes from a close-hauled point-of-sail on one tack (direction) to a close hauled point-of-sail on the other direction. Only the jib needs to be adjusted, the working sheet of the jib is changed and the new working sheet is placed on a winch. The mainsail is left alone and will by itself often assume the correct position. </p>
  <p><u>Jibe:</u> In this maneuver, the stern of the boat goes through the wind as one changes from a broad reach on one tack (direction) to a broad reach in the other tack (direction). Both the jib and mainsail will need adjusting. The mainsail is first centered, the turn made and the mainsail is then let out. The jib's working sheet is changed and the new working sheet is placed on a winch. </p>
  <p><u>Head Up:</u> Change the boat's course toward the wind. </p>
  <p><u>Head Down:</u> Change the boat's course away from the wind. </p>
  <p><u>Bear Away / Fall Off:</u> To head away or off from the wind. </p>
